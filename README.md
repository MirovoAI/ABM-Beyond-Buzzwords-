# ABM-Beyond-Buzzwords-
Why 90% of SaaS Companies Fail at It
Introduction

Account-Based Marketing (ABM) has become one of the most overused buzzwords in B2B SaaS. While every company claims to “do ABM,” most simply run email blasts or targeted ads and call it strategy. This repo explains:

Why most ABM programs fail

How to design ABM that actually drives pipeline

Frameworks and templates you can adapt to your SaaS org
Why ABM Fails in Most Companies

Confusing ABM with Target Lists

Uploading 500 accounts into LinkedIn Ads ≠ ABM.

No Sales Alignment

Sales runs one play, marketing runs another → misaligned touchpoints.

Over-Reliance on Tools

Buying Demandbase/Terminus without strategy. Tools don’t fix broken execution.

Focusing on Vanity Metrics

Measuring likes, impressions, or reach instead of influenced pipeline.
What Real ABM Looks Like
The 3 Models of ABM

1:1 ABM – Deep personalization for strategic $1M+ accounts.

1:Few ABM – Cluster-based campaigns for accounts with similar challenges.

1:Many ABM – Broad, tech-enabled personalization at scale.

ABM Success Equation

Right Accounts + Aligned Messaging + Multi-Channel Touchpoints + Measurable Pipeline Impact
Framework for SaaS ABM

Select Accounts

Partner with sales to define ICP and tier accounts.

Design Messaging

Build value props tailored to account or cluster pain points.

Activate Channels

Orchestrate plays across LinkedIn, email, content, webinars, and SDR outreach.

Measure Impact

Metrics: Pipeline $ influenced, Deal Velocity, Win Rates.
[1:1] Deep personalization → $1M+ deals  
[1:Few] Cluster campaigns → 10–50 accounts  
[1:Many] Scaled plays → 500+ accounts
Identify → Align Messaging → Execute Multi-channel → Measure Pipeline
